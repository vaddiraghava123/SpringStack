Elastic Search
---------------------------------

- It is a full text search
- analytics engine based on apache Lucene
- It easier to perform data aggregation operations on data from multiple sources
- Stores data in a document like format similar to MongoDB
- Data is searilized in JSON format

Example of Elastic search document 

	{
		"first_name":"Raghava",
		"last_name":"Vaddi"
	}
	
Features
		-  It is distributed, Horizantal scalable ( Scale out)
		-  Restful and API centric

Use and good fit for
		-	Storing and operating on unstructured or semi structured data, which may often change in structure.
			
			Due to schema-less nature, adding new columns does not required the overhead of adding a new column to the table.
			
		- Full text searches: 
		   -  By ranking each document for relevance to a search by correlating search terms with document content using TF-IDF count for each document
		   
		   - Fuzzy (Not clearly) searches are able to rank documents by relevance to the search made
		   
		   - Elastic search to be used as a storage and analysis tools for Logs generated by disparate systems
		   
		   - Kiabana (aggregation tools) can be used to build aggregations and visualizations in real-time from the collected data.
		   
Concepts
	
		-	Elastic search works on a concept known as "Inverse Indexing"
		-	Inverse Index is same as "Index present at the back of a book"
		-   Inverted index makes it easier to resolve queries to specific documents they could be related to, based on the keywords present in the query, and speeds up a document retrieval process by limiting the search space of documents to be considered for that query.

Key Term

		- Node
			> It is a JVM process running an instance of the Elastic search runtime, independently accessible over a network by other machines or nodes in a cluster
			
			
		- Index, 
			> An index in Elasticsearch is analogous to tables in relational databases.
			
		Mapping
			> index   -> can be automatically be added when data is pushed to an index
			
		Document:
			> Json,  this would reresent a single row in a table
		Shard:
			> It is block of data that may or may not belong to the same index
			> Say a few hundred GBs or evne a few TBs in size,
				-	It is infeasible to vertically grow storage.
				-   Instead, data is logically divided into shards stored on different nodes,
				which individually operate on the data contained in them. This allows for horizantal scaling.
				
Elastic search setup in local
-----------------------------------------------------
	- Download the elastic search .zip file from [https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch]
	- Version 8.17.2
	- In local, F:\elasticsearch-8.17.2-windows-x86_64\elasticsearch-8.17.2\config
			- elasticsearch.yaml
					modify clustername and path
	- Username - default - "elastic"
	- Password - reset and get new pwd using below command
	  > elasticsearch-8.17.2\bin>elasticsearch-reset-password -u elastic
	  
	 > To bypass the security , add the below line under elasticsearch.yml file
		xpack.security.enabled: false
		
	To launch Elastic search
	> http://localhost:9200
